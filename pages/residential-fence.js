                  We offer various materials for your residential fencing needs,
                  including vinyl, wood, and aluminum. Vinyl fences offer a low
                  maintenance and hassle-free option that is both durable and
                  long-lasting. Wood fences are a classic choice that offers a
                  natural and traditional look, with different styles like
                  picket, lattice-topped, vertical board, post and rail, louver,
                  3 board paddock oak, and more. Aluminum fences, on the other
                  hand, provide an ornamental look that will add prestige and
                  value to your property, with lifetime warranties and low
                  maintenance.
